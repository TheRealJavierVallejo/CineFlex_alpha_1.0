## 🌟 New Studio Features

### 1. Hollywood-Grade Interface

- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Maximize your workspace canvas.
- **Stacked Notifications**: A non-intrusive notification center that keeps you updated without blocking your view.

### 2. Accessibility & Power User Tools

- **Undo Capability**: Deleted a shot by mistake? A toast with an "Undo" button will appear.
- **Focus Management**: Modals trap focus and support Escape key closing.
- **Onboarding Tour**: New users get a guided walkthrough of the studio.

### 3. Two-Column Shot Editor
The core creation tool has been completely redesigned:
- **Left Panel (Controls)**: Tabbed interface for Description, Camera Settings, and Cast selection.
- **Right Panel (Canvas)**: A massive, real-time preview area to see your AI generations in high detail.

### 4. Timeline View
